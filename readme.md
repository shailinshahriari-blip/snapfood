# Snapfood Sentiment Analysis

This project uses Machine Learning to classify Snapfood comments based on their sentiment.

## Model

The model used in this project is LinearSVC.

The text data was converted into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer.

The max_df parameter was changed in different experiments to compare the results.

## Experiment 1 - ngram = 6

In the first experiment, ngram was set to 6.

### Precision Score

- Accuracy: 0.8606221631794532
- Precision for each class: [0.90530018 0.82541568]



### Confusion Matrix

## Experiment 2 - max_df = 0.98

In the second experiment, max_df was set to 0.98.

### Precision Score

- Class 0: 0.00
- Class 1: 0.00
- Class 2: 0.00

### Confusion Matrix

## Experiment 3 - max_df = 0.99

In the third experiment, max_df was set to 0.99.

### Precision Score

- Accuracy: 0.8613970995239677
- Precision for each class: [0.90143992 0.82917083]

## Dataset

The project uses:

- snapfood_train.csv
- snapfood_test.csv

The main columns are:

- comment
- label

For the test data, the actual labels are stored as truth and the model predictions are stored as prediction.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Precision

The Precision Score was calculated separately for each class.
